# Figma plugin

Tokens Studio for Figma is a plugin for Figma allowing you to define and use design tokens in Figma. You can store your design tokens in JSON, sync them with a sync provider such as GitHub and define tokens even for properties that have no native support yet in Figma, such as borderRadius or spacing. You can create color and typography tokens in a granular way by extracting atomic decisions to tokens. You can also define aliases for every token, so that you can reuse your decisions. You can define and apply spacing tokens, allowing you to set the Auto Layout properties in Figma automatically. Think of it like Styles for everything.
